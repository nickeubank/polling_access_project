I am an Assistant Research Professor in the Duke Social Science Research Institute (SSRI), where I study a range of topics related to political accountability, include gerrymandering, social networks, election administration and race and incarceration. I am also a faculty member and Admissions Chair for the Duke Masters in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS), where I strive to provide students of all backgrounds with practical, transferable, data science skills. In particular, I developed and teach two courses that are part of the first-year MIDS curriculum.
