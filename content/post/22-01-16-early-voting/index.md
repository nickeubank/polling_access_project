In 2020, we find that in the 35 states that offer meaningful early voting options, 90\% of colleges do not have an early voting option on campus. For 54\% of colleges, the nearest early voting option is more than a mile away - and for nearly a quarter of colleges the nearest early voting option is more than 3 miles away. Additionally, for 18\% of colleges Starbucks is closer to campus than their nearest early voting option.

\textsuperscript{01} These statistics represent 1,895 colleges in 35 states with meaningful early voting in 2020. Here we define meaningful early voting as a state with in-person early voting, early voting locations beyond county clerk buildings, and with the potential to host an early voting site on a college campus. States not included in this sample either did not allow early voting, or had a very limited form of early voting. The states with meaningful early voting are 'AK', 'AR', 'AZ', 'CA', 'CO', 'DC', 'FL', 'GA', 'IA', 'ID', 'IL', 'IN', 'KS', 'LA', 'MA', 'MD', 'MI', 'MN', 'MT', 'NC', 'ND', 'NE', 'NM', 'NV', 'NY', 'OH', 'OK', 'PA', 'SD', 'TN', 'TX', 'UT', 'VA', 'WI', and 'WV'. Our early voting polling place data comes from Ballot Ready for the 2020 election. Our college campus data comes from the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition (SLSV) and represents all of the campuses listed in the National Student Clearinghouse and minority-serving institutions listed in the Rutgers Center for MSI Directory within the aforementioned states. Our sample of college campuses is further limited to those campuses in the HIFLD database with campus geography. Our college campus data does not include for-profit colleges, specialized medical schools, beauty schools, and other niche specializations. The distance calculated here is ?as the crow flies? distance, or the shortest distance between the edge of campus and the nearest polling place.
