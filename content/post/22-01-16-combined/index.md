## Footnotes
3. These statistics represent 1,728 colleges in 32 states with both meaningful early voting and for which data on election day polling place locations in the 2020 November Presidential were made available by the Center for Public Integrity. Here we define meaningful early voting as a state with in-person early voting, early voting locations beyond county clerk buildings, and with the potential to host an early voting site on a college campus. States not included in this sample either did not allow early voting, had a very limited form of early voting, or were not present in our 2020 election day data. The states with both meaningful early voting and election day voting are: AK, AL, AR, CA, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, TX, UT, VA, VT, WI, and WV. Our early voting polling place data comes from Ballot Ready for the 2020 election. Our 2020 election day polling place data comes from the Center for Public Integrity and was limited to 35 states, some of which did not have meaningful early voting. Our college campus data comes from the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition (SLSV) and represents all of the campuses listed in the National Student Clearinghouse in 2017 and any minority-serving institutions listed in the Rutgers Center for MSI Directory which are not already included in the National Student Clearinghouse data. We then exclude for-profit colleges and universities as well as specialized medical schools, and beauty schools. This provides us with a sample of  3114 colleges and universities across the United States.  To facilitate our geospatial analyses, our sample is then restricted to  2258 college campuses whose campus boundaries are included in the  Department of Homeland Security Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database. These 2,258 colleges had a total enrollment of about 15.6 million students.  In this dataset, we used 2020 enrollment data from The Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for the 68\% of all campuses that have it. When schools are missing from 2020 enrollment data, we use enrollment data from the HIFLD database. Distances reported are calculated as the shortest distance between the edge of campus and the nearest polling place (i.e., the  ?as the crow flies? distance). Target and Starbucks store data comes from ScrapeHero which consists of all the Official Stores present in the United States.
