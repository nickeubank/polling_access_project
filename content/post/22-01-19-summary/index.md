## Introduction
In this website we present preliminary statistical findings relating to the 2020 Presidential election at college campuses across the United States. We begin with paragraph summaries of our most important findings. In following posts we present a list of all statistics in sentence format. Each statistic has a footnote that corresponds to detailed information about the data sources, sample and the method by which the statistic was calculated.

The statistics are calculated for all states with meaningful early voting (for our early voting statistics), all states for which we were able to find data on the location of election day polling places (for election day statistics), and the subset of the states where there was meaningful early voting options and where we were able to secure election day data (for statistics on the nearest early or election day voting option, which we refer to as ?combined statistics?).  Moreover, most statistics have been calculated both to reflect the experience of the average college, and also to reflect the experience of the average student, the latter of which gives greater weight to colleges with larger enrollment.

## Summary
For the 2020 Presidential election, we find that in the 35 states that offer meaningful early voting options, only 10\% of colleges have an early voting option on campus. For 54\% of colleges, the nearest early voting option is more than a mile away; for nearly a quarter of colleges the nearest early voting option is more than 3 miles away. By contrast, a Starbucks is closer to campus than the nearest early voting option for 18\% of colleges. 

If we consider the perspective of the average student?rather than the average campus?the picture is a little more positive, but still still leaves ample room for improvement. We find that only 25\% of college students have an early voting option on campus, and that the nearest early voting option is more than 1 mile from the edge of campus for 41\% of students. But at the same time, 55\% of college students have a Starbucks and 22\% of students have a Target closer than their nearest early voting option.

When it comes to election day voting for the 2020 Presidential election, we find that 76\% of colleges do not have an election day voting option on campus in the 35 states for which we have election day polling place location data. For 16\% of colleges, the nearest election day voting option is more than a mile away, and for 2\% of colleges the nearest election day voting option is more than 3 miles away. By contrast, a Starbucks is closer to campus than the nearest election day voting option for 21\% of colleges in this sample.

Again, the picture is slightly more positive from the perspective of the average student, but still leaves room for improvement; over half of college students (56\%) lack an election day voting option on campus, and for 10\% of students, their nearest election day voting option is more than 1 mile from the edge of campus. For context, 26\% of students have a Starbucks closer to their college than their nearest election day voting option.  

When we examine these statistics for two-year and four-year colleges separately, we find that election day voting options are more accessible for four-year colleges. The nearest election day voting option is within one mile for 91\% of four-year colleges, while this is only true for 80\% of two-year colleges. (Two-year colleges are more likely to be commuter colleges, so we anticipate that their students are less likely to the polling place closest to their college campus when compared to the majority of four year colleges which are residential colleges.)
