## Footnotes
2. These statistics represent 1,816 colleges in 35 states for which data on the location of  election day polling places for the 2020 November presidential election was made available by the Center for Public Integrity. The states for which we have election day voting data in 2020 are: AK, AL, AR, CA, CT,  DE, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, TX, UT, VA, VT, WI, and WV. Our 2020 election day polling place data comes from the Center for Public Integrity and was limited to these 35 states. Our college campus data comes from the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition (SLSV) and represents all of the campuses listed in the National Student Clearinghouse in 2017 and any minority-serving institutions listed in the Rutgers Center for MSI Directory which are not already included in the National Student Clearinghouse data. We then exclude for-profit colleges and universities as well as specialized medical schools, and beauty schools. This provides us with a sample of 3,114 colleges and universities across the United States.  To facilitate our geospatial analyses, our sample is then restricted to the 2,258 college campuses whose campus boundaries are included in the Department of Homeland Security Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database. These 2,258 colleges had a total enrollment of about 15.6 million students.  In this dataset, we used 2020 enrollment data from The Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for the 68\% of all campuses that have it. When colleges are missing from 2020 enrollment data, we use enrollment data from the HIFLD database. Distances reported are calculated as the shortest distance between the edge of campus and the nearest polling place (i.e., the  “as the crow flies” distance). Target and Starbucks store data comes from ScrapeHero which consists of all the Official Stores present in the United States.
