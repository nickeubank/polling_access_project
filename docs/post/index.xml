      <description>&lt;p&gt;For all colleges in the 35 states with meaningful early voting in 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;average-college-perspective&#34;&gt;Average College Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% of colleges do not have an early voting option on campus.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nearest early voting option is more than 1 mile from the edge of campus for 54% of colleges.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nearest early voting option is more than 3 miles from the edge of campus for 23% of colleges.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nearest early voting option is more than 5 miles from the edge of campus for 15% of colleges.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18% of colleges are closer to their nearest Starbucks than their nearest early voting option.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3% of colleges are closer to their nearest Target than their nearest early voting option.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nearest early voting option is more than 1 mile away from the edge of campus for 63% of 2-year colleges and universities.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nearest early voting option is more than 1 mile away from the edge of campus for 46% of 4-year colleges and universities.&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;average-student-perspective&#34;&gt;Average Student Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75% of students do not have an on campus early voting option.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;41% of students have their nearest early voting option greater than 1 mile from the edge of campus.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55% of students have a Starbucks closer than their nearest Early Voting Option.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22% of students have a Target closer than their nearest Early Voting Option.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These statistics are calculated using information on 1,896 colleges in 35 states with meaningful early voting for the 2020 Presidential election. Here we define meaningful early voting as a state with in-person early voting beyond county clerk buildings, and therefore with the potential to host an early voting site on a college campus. States not included in this sample either did not allow early voting, or had a very limited form of early voting that did not allow for the possibility of early voting on college campuses. The states with meaningful early voting are: AK, AR, AZ, CA, CO, DC, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, MI, MN, MT, NC, ND, NE, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, PA, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WI, and WV. Our early voting polling place data comes from Ballot Ready for the 2020 November Presidential election. Our college campus data comes from the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition (SLSV) and represents all of the campuses listed in the National Student Clearinghouse in 2017 and any minority-serving institutions listed in the Rutgers Center for MSI Directory which are not already included in the National Student Clearinghouse data. We then exclude for-profit colleges and universities as well as specialized medical schools, and beauty schools. This provides us with a sample of 3,114 colleges and universities across the United States.  To facilitate our geospatial analyses, our sample is then restricted to the 2,258 college campuses whose campus boundaries are included in the Department of Homeland Security Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database. These 2,258 colleges had a total enrollment of about 15.6 million students.  In this dataset, we use 2020 enrollment data from The Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for the 68% of all campuses that have it. When colleges are missing from 2020 enrollment data, we use enrollment data from the HIFLD database. Distances reported are calculated as the shortest distance between the edge of campus and the nearest polling place (i.e., the  ?as the crow flies? distance). Target and Starbucks store data comes from ScrapeHero which consists of all the Official Stores present in the United States in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These statistics represent 1,816 colleges in 35 states for which data on the location of  election day polling places for the 2020 November presidential election was made available by the Center for Public Integrity. The states for which we have election day voting data in 2020 are: AK, AL, AR, CA, CT,  DE, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, TX, UT, VA, VT, WI, and WV.
