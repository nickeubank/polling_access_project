[{"authors":["adrianefresh"],"categories":null,"content":"I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Duke University. I received my PhD in Political Science at Stanford in 2017, and my MA in Economics at Stanford in 2015. I study the political economy of development. My research concerns how elites respond to dramatic economic and institutional changes. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in the effects of these changes on elite persistence and the strategies that elites employ to contend with potential disruptions to their power. I study a diverse set of historical time periods and country contexts including the Industrial Revolution in Britain, regime change in Chile, and black enfranchisement in the US. I am interested in quantitative methods, and I have a particular interest in causal inference in the context of observational research, as well as natural language processing using large corpuses of historical and historiographical text.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ef67f855ec83389f2c742ec41b9dfc0c","permalink":"https://collegevoteaccess.com/author/adriane-fresh/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/adriane-fresh/","section":"authors","summary":"I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Duke University.
